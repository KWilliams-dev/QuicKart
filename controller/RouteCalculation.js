// This is where the algorithm for generating the fastest route will take place.
// User will enter in list of items (ShoppingList.js) -> our code will store it in a array list
// Import that array list into this file -> develop a way to sort it in closest item - furthest item
// -> Return (export) updated/sorted list to front end (ShoppingRoute.js) to display it to the user.
