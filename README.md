# QuicKart
This is the GitHub repo for the team working on the QuicKart mobile android application. The goal is to enable users to enhance their shopping experience with an app that can give them the fastest route to their items within the store.

The project repository can be found [here](https://github.com/KWilliams-dev/QuicKart).

## Build Instructions
 
<strong>1.</strong> Clone the repository into your local machine.
<strong>2.</strong> Ensure that you have nodejs and npm installed with the following commands: (You should see something like "v16.13.2")
```
node -v
```
```
npm -v
```
- ### <em><strong>Note</strong></em>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If your running a different version of node and run into issues with this project. I'm currently running NodeJS v16.13.2 and npm v8.12.1. Installing those versions directly may help.


<strong>3.</strong> Use the cd command in the terminal of your project directory to get into src and then view. 
Ex:
```
cd src/view
```
<strong>4.</strong> This will take you into where the front end portion of the project lives. At this point run
```
npm install 
```
<strong>5.</strong> After that, you'll need to set up the back end portion of project following similar steps
```
cd src/model
npm install
```
- ### <em><strong>Note</strong></em>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After completing these steps, the project will not be running but you will have node_modules directory built and the dependencies that the
project relies on ready to go.

## Running the project

- ### <em><strong>Note</strong></em>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I recommend going over some of the docks on this website https://docs.expo.dev/ and also testing out expo in the browser here https://snack.expo.dev/ to familiarize yourself with the technology. There will be some account creation involved.

To run the front end of the project, make sure you're in the view directory in your terminal and then run the command
```
npm run web
```
You'll see a QR code pop up in your terminal. If your on an iphone, just download the Expo Go app from the app store.
